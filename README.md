This is not fully functional yet. Check issue https://github.com/realKarthikNair/EPP-systemd/issues/1 before using. Currently it sets the scaling governor to powersave and energy performance preference to `balance_performance` (instead of the `default balance_power`) on every boot. This was necessary because my 16-xf0xxx "lagged" a bit on `balance_power`.
